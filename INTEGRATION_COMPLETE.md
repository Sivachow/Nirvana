# 🧘 Nirvana AI Extension - Complete Integration

## What We Built

I've successfully integrated **AI-powered natural language control** into your Nirvana Chrome extension. Users can now simply open a spotlight (Cmd+Shift+K) and type commands like "Add buy groceries to my next list" - the AI understands the intent and executes the appropriate API calls.

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **AI Handler (`content/ai-handler.js`)**
- Uses OpenAI's function calling (GPT-4o-mini)
- Defines 6 AI functions: add_task, update_task, complete_task, delete_task, search_tasks, list_tasks
- Intelligently routes user commands to Nirvana API
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions

### 2. **Enhanced Spotlight (`content/spotlight.js`)**
- Updated to use AI handler instead of test API
- Shows AI responses with success/error/loading states
- Special commands: `/setkey` and `/clear`
- Auto-closes after successful operations

### 3. **Settings Page (`options.html` + `options.js`)**
- Beautiful UI for configuring OpenAI API key
- Secure storage in Chrome's encrypted storage
- Usage instructions and keyboard shortcuts

### 4. **Updated Styling (`content/spotlight.css`)**
- Added response display with color-coded states
- Smooth animations
- Loading states

### 5. **Documentation**
- **README.md**: Quick start and overview
- **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**: Technical deep-dive
- **TESTING.md**: Complete testing guide
- **MCP_GUIDE.md**: Future MCP integration path
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Visual diagrams and flows

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create new API key
3. Copy it (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Install Extension
1. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select your Nirvana folder

### 3. Configure

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Chrome Extension
├── Token Capture (inject.js)
├── API Client (nirvana-api.js)
├── Token Manager (token-manager.js)
├── Data Cache (nirvana-data.js)
├── AI Handler (ai-handler.js) ← NEW!
├── Spotlight UI (spotlight.js) ← UPDATED!
└── Settings (options.html) ← NEW!
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ API key stored in Chrome's encrypted storage
- ✅ All communication over HTTPS
- ✅ Tokens never logged in plain text
- ✅ Works only on focus.nirvanahq.com
- ✅ No data sent anywhere except OpenAI + Nirvana

## 💰 Cost Considerations

**OpenAI API Costs (GPT-4o-mini):**
- Input: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$0.60 per 1M tokens

**Typical command cost: ~$0.001** (one tenth of a cent)

For 1000 commands/month: ~$1

You can switch to gpt-3.5-turbo for even lower costs.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured"
→ Set API key in Options or use `/setkey` command

### "Auth token not set"
→ Refresh Nirvana page, check console for "Token captured"

### Spotlight doesn't open
→ Make sure you're on focus.nirvanahq.com
→ Try reloading extension

### Functions not executing
→ Verify token captured (Console should show message)
→ Check API key is valid
→ Look for errors in Console
